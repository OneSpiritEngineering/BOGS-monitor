Rasp-Pi plant monitoring system
Python code is being developed for a STEM project that will be used in grade school classrooms to allow students to participate in a real-world Bioponics 
  development effort to grow food in remote areas of the Third World.  
This Bioponic project is using worms, organisms, and bacteria to reduce organic matter to plant useable nutrients.
At One Spirit Engineering, we are designing a food growing system that uses very little water and a minimal amount of solar generated electricity to autonomously grow food.
